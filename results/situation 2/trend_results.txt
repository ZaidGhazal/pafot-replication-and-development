 description: Measures the trend of fitness values across generations. "
            "- Spearman’s rho indicates the direction and strength of a monotonic trend "
            "(positive → increasing, negative → decreasing). "
            "- The p-value tests the significance of that correlation (p < 0.05 → significant). "
            "- The Theil–Sen slope gives the estimated rate of change per generation, "
            "with its confidence interval showing uncertainty. "
            "→ Interpretation: If rho > 0 and p < 0.05, fitness is improving over generations; "
            "if rho < 0 and p < 0.05, it is deteriorating; otherwise, it is stable.

 description: Assesses whether the probability of collisions changes monotonically with generation, "
            "using the Cochran–Armitage trend test. "
            "- Z_stat > 0 suggests an increasing trend in collision rate; "
            "Z_stat < 0 suggests a decreasing trend. "
            "- The p-value indicates significance (p < 0.05 → significant trend). "
            "→ Interpretation: If p < 0.05 and Z_stat < 0, collisions are decreasing (improving safety); "
            "if p < 0.05 and Z_stat > 0, collisions are increasing; otherwise, collision rate is stable.

 description: Evaluates whether average execution time changes across generations. "
            "- Spearman’s rho measures monotonic direction; p-value tests significance. "
            "- The Theil–Sen slope estimates how execution time changes per generation. "
            "→ Interpretation: If rho > 0 and p < 0.05, execution time is increasing; "
            "if rho < 0 and p < 0.05, it is decreasing; if p ≥ 0.05 or the confidence interval crosses 0, "
            "there is no significant trend and execution time is stable.
